\caption{OIL's feature model of the space of machine learning options for ABEN.  In this model, $\mathit{Subset Selection}$, $\mathit{Similarity}$, $\mathit{Adaption Mechanism}$ and $\mathit{Analogy Selection}$ are the mandatory {\em features}, while the $\mathit{Feature Weighting}$ and $\mathit{Discretization Method}$ {\em features} are optimal. To avoid making the graph too complex, some cross-tree constrains are not presented.}
